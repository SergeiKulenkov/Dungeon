## Dungeon crawler with a lot of randomness made with pygame. And it's my first serious Python project.

### _Features_:
* random rooms with enemies, items or food
* action log describing combat turns and enemies
* final score with three categories
* lucky parries and cool items, sometimes with critical damage
* config file that's easy to access and edit
